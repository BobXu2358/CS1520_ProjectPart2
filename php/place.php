      The name of my hometown is <b>Hangzhou</b>, which is near the east coast of China.<br/>
      <img src="../image/Hangzhou.jpg"><br/>
      I was born and raised there, although I have a lot of experience staying in other cities, I still cannot find a
      second place that can provide better life I had in Hangzhou.<br/>
      The city can look very cool<br/>

      But it can also turn to a cozy place to live (and I love this side of my hometown more):

      By far, it is still my first choice for retiring.
