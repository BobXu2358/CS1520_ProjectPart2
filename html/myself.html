      My name is Xinhai Xu. I am a senior undergraduate student in University of Pittsburgh major in Computer Science.
      I am an international student originally from China. Although I am not a native English speaker, the four-year study
      in the U.S. has made my English fluent. <br/> I learned some skills from school including JAVA, C, PHP (learning),
      JavaScript(learning), HTML and Android. Besides that, I am a huge fan of video games, especially in designing and
      developing them. Although there is no more courses about gaming in my school department by the time I became a CS student,
      I have some Unity3D experience and played around with Cocos2d-X engine a little bit basically through self-study.
